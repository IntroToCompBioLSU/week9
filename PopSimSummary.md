My script prompts for generation number population size and carrying capacity. With a built in setting for the poisson having a lamda of 5.0 meaning the average offspring production is 5 if they are able to reproduce.
 Because of the large size of my average offspring the carrying capacity was reached very quickly when I ran the simulation.
Unfortunately my computer crashed and I am unable to reinstall the matlibplot before i could run the simulation multiple times changing each variable but the few times I ran the simulation increasing the popsize closer to the carrying capacity would allow for much less years of generations to progress before the population platued.
