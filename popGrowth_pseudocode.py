# Will need pyplot to plot results and numpy.random to draw from Poisson

# Define our starting population size

# Create an empty list to hold population sizes across generations

# Add our starting pop'n size to the list

# Define the number of generations for our simulation

# Define a carrying capacity for our population

# Define an intrinsic rate of reproduction for individuals in our population,
# when not limited by carrying capacity. This will be the rate parameter for our
# Poisson.

# Loop to iterate across generations

	# Progress indicator

    # Initializing variable to hold pop'n size for the next generation

    # Looping over individuals in the current population
    
    	# Add offspring for each individual in the population to the next generation
    	
    # If I have more individuals than my carrying capacity allows, limit the size to the 
    # carrying capacity
        
    # Add my new population size to my list of population sizes
    
    # Update current population size to the new generation

# Print my population sizes to the screen

# Create a plot of my population sizes through time
