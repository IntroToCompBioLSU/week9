In running my simulation, I found that my population, over a short number of generations, would hit its carrying capacity and stay there.
This was likely due to the fact that I set a parameter for my simulation not to exceed carrying capacity.
In a perfect world, a population will start from an initial number of individuals, experience growth in their population, and experience stabilization
of said growth in and around their carrying capacity (with intermittent fluctuations above and below carrying capacity). The world, however, is not
perfect. It gives rise to my curiosity regarding the logistics of running a simulation like this one and adding factors in like predation
or competition.
