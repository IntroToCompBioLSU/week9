When the mean/ average of offspring in the simulation is less than 1, .99 or less, the population will eventually go exstinct. Should the mean offspring be one or greater, the population will prevail. Should the mean be greater than one, the population could reach carrying capacity should there be enough generations. The number of generations and mean offspring are directly proportional to population growth. The greater the number of generations, and the greater the mean for offspring per individual, the higher probablity for reaching carrying capacity. Consider also that the number of generations needed to reach carrying capacity will decrease for those similations with a mean offspring greater than one, as initial population increases closer to the carrying capacity.
