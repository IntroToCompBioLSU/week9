<<Summary of week9 population simulation>>

Trial 1 (popsim1):
Starting population size: 5
Number of Generations: 100
Carrying capacity: 100
Simulation ran and plotted a graph that plateus at 100.

Trial 2 (popsim2):
Starting population size: 100
Number of Generations: 10
Carrying capacity: 20
First two times I ran simulation, I got an error (presumably because starting pop
was more than the carrying capacity). Third time I ran it, I got the figure
indicated above.

Trial 3:
I'm pretty sure I overwhelmed the simulation with really big numbers.
I was curious what would happen, and it took forever to run through it.
End result was my vmware freezing and restarting.
