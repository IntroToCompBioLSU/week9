With the population growth simulator, I noticed a few key things. When the mean number of offspring 
(set by me as the author of the script, not the user), is above 1, the generational population sizes 
continue to increase until they plateau at the user- defined carrying capacity. When the mean number 
of offspring was set to be less than 1, the population sizes shrunk before dying out. The patterns 
that occurred really only changed when the mean number of offspring was changed in the script. 
Otherwise, similar patterns arose even when the user altered the initial population size, the 
carrying capacity, and the number of generations, just different numbers were printed and different 
numbers of numbers were printed.
