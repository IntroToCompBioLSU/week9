I tried several different configurations of the population, inputting different startig population sizes, number of generations to run, and carrying capacity of the population. majority of the time the population would grow right up to the carrying capacity and then plateau. Sometimes the population would fluctuate by a sharp increase in growth and then a sharp plummet to extinction and then back again. there was once that the population just immediately went to extinction, but that was because the growth rate was randomly chosen at zero. The fluctuations could be because of the resources getting used up and causing the population to go towards extinction which then allows what ever population is left to have more resources to them selves increasing the population size again.
