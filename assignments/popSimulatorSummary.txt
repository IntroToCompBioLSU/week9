In running this script multiple times, I noticed that no matter what the initial population size and carrying capacity were <br>
the population would often max out at the carrying capacity within a relatively short amount of generations. <br>
When one thinks about this, though, it is logical, because if each individual in the population produced, on average, <br>
two offspring -which they do in this population- and then died, the population would be doubling after each generation. <br>
Even with an initial population size of 5 and a carrying capacity of 10000, the population reaches the carrying capacity
in about thirteen generations.
