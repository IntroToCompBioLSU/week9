   The formula seems weird. As the generation size increases, it drastically changes the results. If you run.... start pop 5, gen 10, and carrying 10000, you'll get a simple curve up to the carrying capacity. But if you merly change the generation size to 100, you'll get drastically different results. Also, sometimes the program may need to be ran multiple times before it produces a correct graph.
