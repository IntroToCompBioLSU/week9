My first trial: The Starting population size was 28, the carrying capacity was 2000, and the number of generations was 40. The growth rate was 2.0 
and strangely the population size passed the carrying capacity after the fifth generation, but didn't immediately die off. The future generations
continously alternated between being over 2000 and under 1700. It seems somewhat realistic that after going over the carrying capacity, the next 
generation(s) experienced a decrease in population size and then once food was replenished, the popualtion size grew again.

Second trial: The Carrying capacity was 500, the growth rate was 1.0, my starting population was 18, and my number of generations was 100. The population 
size rises exponentially and at the sixth generation the population size reaches the carrying capacity. The population size equals the carrying 
capacity for the rest of the generations. Realistically, it is unlikely that a population would be able to stay at carrying capacity for that many
generations if you consider outside variables such as disease affecting the population. 

Third trial: The growth rate was 2.0, the carrying capacity was 100, the starting population was 14, and the number of generations was 90. Within 
three generations the population size went above the carry capacity and fluctuated around the carrying capacity for the rest of the generations,
similar to my first trial. 

The fact that for each trial my population reached carrying capacity within a few generations and stayed there may be because I didn't set any 
variables that would stop the population from exceeding carrying capacity. The trials that had 2.0 as the growth rate reached carrying capacity 
sooner (this is expected).
